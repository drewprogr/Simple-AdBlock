# Simple-AdBlock
A fast lightweight adblocker created with javascript

How to use this chrome extension -
1. Enable dev mode by going to chrome://extensions/ and checking the box at the top right of the page
2. CLick Load Unpacked and then select the folder that I have attached on this post
3. Turn on the extension and it should be enabled

note - 
this extension is not meant to be a robust pop-up blocker, it is instead intended to be a simple adblocker that has no real impact on speed.
